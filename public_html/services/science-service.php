        Science is related to research, and is normally organized by a university, a college or a research institute.
        Contemporary science is typically subdivided into the natural sciences which study the material world,
        the social sciences which study people and societies,
        and the formal sciences like mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
        The formal sciences are often excluded as they do not depend on empirical observations.
        Disciplines which use science like engineering and medicine may also be considered to be applied sciences.
