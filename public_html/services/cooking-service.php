        Cooking or cookery is the art, technology and craft of preparing food for consumption with or without the use of heat.
        Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric
        stoves, to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting unique environmental, economic, and cultural traditions
        and trends. The ways or types of cooking also depend on the skill and type of training an individual cook has.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments.
        Cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence of heat, such as in ceviche,
        a traditional South American dish where fish is cooked with the acids in lemon or lime juice.
