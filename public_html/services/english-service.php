        English is an Indo-European language, and belongs to the West Germanic group of the Germanic languages.
        Old English originated from a Germanic tribal and linguistic continuum along the coast of the North Sea,
        whose languages are now known as the Anglo-Frisian subgroup within West Germanic.
    </p>
    <p>
        As such, the modern Frisian languages are the closest living relatives of Modern English.
        Low German/Low Saxon is also closely related, and sometimes English, the Frisian languages,
        and Low German are grouped together as the Ingvaeonic, though this grouping remains debated.
