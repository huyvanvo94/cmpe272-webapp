        A foreign language is originally from another country. It is also a language not spoken in the native country
        of the person referred to, i.e., an English speaker living in Spain can say that Spanish is a foreign language
        to him or her. These two characterisations do not exhaust the possible definitions, however,
        and the label is occasionally applied in ways that are variously misleading or factually inaccurate.
