        Education is seen as the golden ticket to a better life, however this ticket is not being taken by many young individuals at the perfect age to pursue higher education. For various reasons, students have no drive or interest in the benefits of the institutions that surround them. Here, we believe it is our mission and duty to enrich 
        the lives of students all over the world through
        our platform online or in person. 
    </p>

        We are a team of highly trained, professional tutoring experts. We provide individualized tutoring at our learning center.
        We teach using an academic training program and curriculum that has developed some of the top students in the Bay Area.
        Those students have grown with us, graduated from our local schools and moved on to obtain merit
        scholarships at Stanford University, UC Berkeley, MIT, Harvard, Cornell, Brown, and other top universities in the nation.
