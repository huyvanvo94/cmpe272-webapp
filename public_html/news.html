    <h4 class="headline">SAT Test</h4>

    <p class="paragraph">
        There have been some significant changes to the SAT test that high school students and
        their parents need to be aware of. As of 2016, the test has a different format, different
        scoring, and even measures different skills. How will these changes affect your child’s
        preparation and testing experience? Should students take the new SAT test or plan to take
        the ACT instead? Join us for a look at the new test’s math section and a comparison between
        the new SAT and the ACT tests.
